Project Title:
Real-Time Stock Ticker
 Project Description:
The Real-Time Stock Ticker is a web-based application that displays live stock market data for selected companies. It continuously updates stock prices, percentage changes, and market trends using real-time APIs. This project helps users monitor stock fluctuations instantly without the need to refresh the page manually.
The app is built using React.js for the front-end interface and uses WebSocket or REST APIs (like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance API) for fetching live market data. It provides an easy-to-understand interface that shows company name, stock symbol, current price, daily high/low, and percentage change with color indicators (green for gain, red for loss).
Objectives:
To develop a web application that displays live stock prices dynamically.


To use React.js for creating a responsive, real-time user interface.


To implement API integration for fetching and updating market data.


To visualize real-time trends using dynamic updates or charts.


To enhance user understanding of stock market behavior through simple UI design.
